# Alities

A trivia-based design and development environment that generates a variety of games.

## What is Alities?

Alities is a platform where creators design trivia game templates and topic packs, and the engine generates playable game instances from them. Players can experience trivia through multiple game formats — quiz shows, flashcard drills, bracket eliminations, and more.
